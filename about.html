							<h2>My Story</h2>
							<p>
								I am a budding UX designer who just
								completed the UX Design Immersion course
								at CareerFoundry. I love learning and am
								constantly taking classes about things I find
								interesting, which is evident in the multiple
								degrees I have pursued. I have a BA in film
								studies with a minor in digital art in
								computer science. My minor allowed me to
								explore game design, 3D graphics, graphic
								design, and building interactive art pieces. I also have a BS in veterinary technology
								which became my profession for the last 9 years. While I love helping animals, I really
								missed the creativity in digital art and sought out a career change where a few of my
								skills may translate, and thus, stumbled upon UX Design.
							</p>
							<p>
								I spent almost a decade being a user experience designer for animals. I would
								make sure their desires were met constantly, from figuring out what type of food a
								finicky cat might want to eat, to setting up their cage in such a way that they were
								happy, comfortable, and felt safe. Most importantly, I was an advocate for those
								without a voice, which is a skill I plan to use to advocate insistently for my users.</p>
							<p>
								I now have a certificate in UX Design through CareerFoundry where I learned
								how to create user personas and user flows, build wireframes and prototypes, conduct
								user research, and construct user-centered responsive designs. I also completed the UI
								for UX Designers specialty course. There I was able to delve deeper into UI/UX design
								by designing for different breakpoints, using visual design principles, applying color
								and image theory, and creating style guides for handoff and collaboration.
							</p>
							<p>
								I would love to work as a UX/UI designer for a company that believes in leaving
								the world better than they found it, and if they want to help animals, that is just a
								plus!

						<h2>Interests</h2>
						<p>
							I love reading. I try to read every day and my current GoodReads challenge is to read 20 books this year. 
							I am obsessed with board games and own close to 50. I would love to
							create my own someday. I am also a fan of all things Disney and am currently taking
							their Imagineering in a Box and Pixar in a Box courses on Khan Academy for fun. Most
							of all, I love animals. I have 2 cats named Tsunami and Fred and love spending time
							with them whenever I can. I plan to continue to help animals any way I can as I
							transition into this new career frontier.
