                  <p>
                    InkMe was a project for my CareerFoundry UX Immersion course, meant to teach me the basics of UX Design thinking 
                    while building a prototype I could be passionate about. The project took approximately 6 months to complete 
                    and I was the solo UX Designer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    InkMe is a mobile app created to help users find tattoo inspiration, 
                    chat with potential artists, find local shops, and participate in the tattoo community.
                    The main goal of inkMe is to reduce potential regret after getting a tattoo, which will hopefully be achieved
                    through use of the features provided.

            <p>Our tattoo app users need a way to find local, affordable tattoo artists that specialize 
              in their desired style because they want to work with an artist they enjoy and who will 
              provide them with a service they want to help minimize the possibility of regret. 
              We will know this to be true when we see users who continue to use our app to find 
              inspiration for their pieces, who refer our service to others, and who are happy 
              with their tattoo after using our app.</p>

              <p>InkMe was my first full UX Designer project for my UX Immersion course. I was very happy with my final result as I had never designed an app before and was using all of the tools for the first time. I really enjoyed iterating upon my designs, taking my user feedback, and improving the functionality of the app. I was especially happy with my realization to move from the clunky pop-out menu to the navigation bar of a native app. </p>

              <h1>what didn't go well</h1>
              <p>The terminology of the menu items and the organization was very hard to figure out and work with my users. Learning to let my original attachments go was a struggle. I also felt somewhat limited in what I could create with Sketch and how I could bring my prototypes to life, though this had more to do with my own lack of experience and not a problem with the program itself. I feel I still had a lot to learn in terms of image placement, color choices, and typography.</p>

            <div>
              <h1>future improvements</h1>
              <p>I would love to add more pages to the app, creating what it would be like to actually search or browse through the pages of styles. I would also try to simplify and clean up the look of the app overall. I had multiple comments from peers about how they expected a darker theme. I would potentially create a dark theme version of the app to make it edgier and more fitting for tattoo searching.</p>

          <p>Following my UI specialty course, I decided to go back and tweak my original design to create an edgy, dark look. I took a few key pages and redesigned them in Sketch. I also took this as an opportunity to create a realistically interactive prototype and learn how to use ProtoPie in the process. I am very pleased with the new look of the app, as are my previous users who originally tested the app. One actually said, “It looks like a real app now!”. I plan to recreate each page and build a fully interactive prototype. Stay tuned!</p>
