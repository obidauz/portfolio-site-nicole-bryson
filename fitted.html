                  My role is this project was as a UI designer. It took me approximately 2 months to design Fitted for my CareerFoundry course. Fitted is a responsive web app designed to help find or reignite their passion for fitness. 
                  It was created to help users fit workouts into their busy schedules and keep them motivated to get and stay in shape.

            <p><b>Who:</b> People who are new or returning to fitness, want to find activities they like, and get into a good routine will be interested in FITTED.</p>
            <p><b>What:</b> A responsive web app is best for Fitted, as users can search and view routines, guides, daily challenges, and other information on any device. They can also keep a schedule by adding sessions to their personal calendar.</p>
            <p><b>When:</b> As a web app aims to get users into a routine that suits them, the web app can be used whenever they like. They will use the web app while they are searching for, scheduling, and following routines.</p>
            <p><b>Where:</b> When on the go or when practicing exercise routines at home, in the park, on the street, etc. Users can stay fit anywhere, as long as theyâ€™re logged in on a device.</p>
            <p><b>Why:</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>To become healthy and enjoy the associated benefits (better mood, weight management, reduced risks of illness, learning something new)</li>
                <li>Exercise should be fun and suited to each user</li>
                <li>To save time by fitting exercise into daily routines, such as walking or cycling to work or school</li>

            <h1>MOOD BOARDS</h1>
            <p>Before I could decide upon colors and typography to add to my high-fidelity wireframes, I created two mood boards of two different themes, a light and a dark.</p>
            <!-- create 2 rows for light and dark mood boards with 2 columns each -->
            <!-- light mood board row -->

              <div>
                <h1>light mood board</h1>
                <p>
                  The first theme is lighter and is inspired by exercising in nature. 
                  I wanted to create an atmosphere of exercising on your own time in whatever space makes you happy. 
                  So I create the mood board to showcase the colors and feelings you could find while working out on a beach. 
                  It is meant to be serene and emphasize self care. 
                </p>

              <div>
                <h1>dark mood board</h1>
                <p>
                  The second, darker design was inspired by workout clothes and classic neon signs, but with a modern edge. 
                  I wanted to elicit a feeling of excitement and energy. 
                  This mood board was created with action and motion in mind, and was made to be more edgy than its lighter counterpart.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <!-- end dark mood board row-->
            <p>
              As the targeted user is a very busy tech savvy woman who needs motivation and inspiration to get in shape and lose weight, 
              I believed that the darker, more energetic mood board was the correct design choice for FITTED. 
              It is bright, engaging, and meant to really inspire action and progress.

                <li>While I had always planned to make the app dark themed, I really enjoyed creating a mockup of the light theme. It stretched my color creativity and I believe it actually would make a nice app.</li>
                <li>Creating the animated screens on proto.io was really enjoyable and I believe they turned out well. I especially liked creating the loading screen animation. </li>

              <ul>
                <li>I had a very hard time with creating the responsive designs. I originally went with the default desktop size in Sketch which did not fit any of the mockups I liked, and therefore I had to completely redo the screens.</li>
                <li>I spent a lot of time going back and forth between color choices and typography which ate a lot of time and caused me to rush through some aspects of the design (such as the profile page which is still no where near where I want it to be).</li>
                <li>Making my own icons was very difficult and time consuming. I spent a lot of time learning how to draw icons in Sketch and it just seemed unnecessarily painful.</li>
              </ul>

                <li>I want to eventually make a profile page worthy of the rest of the app. I have a lot of ideas but due to time constraints I was unable to complete the profile page to the best of my ability. </li>
                <li>I would like to learn how to use Adobe Illustrator to create my icons. I found Sketch very clunky and tricky to use for that. I also feel like learning a new skill like Illustrator couldnâ€™t hurt.</li>
                <li>Looking through my designs, I want to fix a few of the button styles so they are all uniform throughout. </li>
