            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>To motivate people into an exercise routine the suits their level, schedule, and interests</p>
            <h3>The 5 Ws of FITTED</h3>
            <p><b>Who:</b> People who are new or returning to fitness, want to find activities they like, and get into a good routine will be interested in FITTED.</p>
            <p><b>What:</b> A responsive web app is best for Fitted, as users can search and view routines, guides, daily challenges, and other information on any device. They can also keep a schedule by adding sessions to their personal calendar.</p>
            <p><b>When:</b> As a web app aims to get users into a routine that suits them, the web app can be used whenever they like. They will use the web app while they are searching for, scheduling, and following routines.</p>
            <p><b>Where:</b> When on the go or when practicing exercise routines at home, in the park, on the street, etc. Users can stay fit anywhere, as long as theyâ€™re logged in on a device.</p>
            <p><b>Why:</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>To become healthy and enjoy the associated benefits (better mood, weight management, reduced risks of illness, learning something new)</li>
                <li>Exercise should be fun and suited to each user</li>
                <li>To save time by fitting exercise into daily routines, such as walking or cycling to work or school</li>

            <p>
              Fitted users are busy, tech savvy professionals who need to find a way to fit exercise into their hectic schedules.
              <br>These users can be at varying stages of experience, but are often exercise novices, or have fallen out of practice and need to get back into a routine.

            </picture>
            <h3>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>Using Sketch, I built upon my low-fidelity wireframes, creating mid-fidelity wireframes and improving upon the design.</p>
          </div>
          <!-- end mid-fidelity wireframes -->

          <!-- start mood boards -->
          <div>
            <h3>Mood Boards</h3>
            <p>Before I could decide upon colors and typography to add to my high-fidelity wireframes, I created two mood boards of two different themes, a light and a dark.</p>
            <!-- create 2 rows for light and dark mood boards with 2 columns each -->
            <!-- light mood board row -->
            <div>
              <div>

                  <source srcset="img/fitted/1x/light_mood_board@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
                  <img src="img/fitted/2x/light_mood_board@2x.jpg" alt="light mood board">
                </picture>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>Light Mood Board</h4>
                <p>
                  The first theme is lighter and is inspired by exercising in nature. 
                  I wanted to create an atmosphere of exercising on your own time in whatever space makes you happy. 
                  So I create the mood board to showcase the colors and feelings you could find while working out on a beach. 
                  It is meant to be serene and emphasize self care. 
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <!-- end light mood board row -->
            <!-- dark mood board row -->
            <div>

                  <source srcset="img/fitted/1x/dark_mood_board@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
                  <img src="img/fitted/2x/dark_mood_board@2x.jpg" alt="dark mood board">
                </picture>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>Dark Mood Board</h4>
                <p>
                  The second, darker design was inspired by workout clothes and classic neon signs, but with a modern edge. 
                  I wanted to elicit a feeling of excitement and energy. 
                  This mood board was created with action and motion in mind, and was made to be more edgy than its lighter counterpart.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <!-- end dark mood board row-->
            <p>
              As the targeted user is a very busy tech savvy woman who needs motivation and inspiration to get in shape and lose weight, 
              I believed that the darker, more energetic mood board was the correct design choice for FITTED. 
              It is bright, engaging, and meant to really inspire action and progress.
            </p>

              <h3>What Went Well</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Creating a user flow before anything else really allowed me to figure out the layout of the app and made it much easier to build the pages quickly and efficiently</li>
                <li>While I had always planned to make the app dark themed, I really enjoyed creating a mockup of the light theme. It stretched my color creativity and I believe it actually would make a nice app.</li>
                <li>Creating the animated screens on proto.io was really enjoyable and I believe they turned out well. I especially liked creating the loading screen animation. </li>
                <li>I am very happy with my neon effect throughout my app.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>What Didn't Go Well</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>I had a very hard time with creating the responsive designs. I originally went with the default desktop size in Sketch which did not fit any of the mockups I liked, and therefore I had to completely redo the screens.</li>
                <li>I spent a lot of time going back and forth between color choices and typography which ate a lot of time and caused me to rush through some aspects of the design (such as the profile page which is still no where near where I want it to be).</li>
                <li>Making my own icons was very difficult and time consuming. I spent a lot of time learning how to draw icons in Sketch and it just seemed unnecessarily painful.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>I want to eventually make a profile page worthy of the rest of the app. I have a lot of ideas but due to time constraints I was unable to complete the profile page to the best of my ability. </li>
                <li>I would like to learn how to use Adobe Illustrator to create my icons. I found Sketch very clunky and tricky to use for that. I also feel like learning a new skill like Illustrator couldnâ€™t hurt.</li>
                <li>Looking through my designs, I want to fix a few of the button styles so they are all uniform throughout. </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
